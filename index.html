				<h2> Background Information</h2>
				<p> The Radio Observatory on the Lunar Surface for Solar Studies (ROLSS) is an observatory made to measure signals from the sun under 20 MHz on the lunar surface. Sun activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME), often produce radio waves under 20 MHz (1). However, ROLSS will measure from the lunar surface because frequencies below 20 MHz are blocked by Earth’s ionosphere, making ground observation of such frequencies impossible. </p>

				<p>Our project involved making a proof-of-concept prototype of ROLSS. Our prototype was split into two parts: a solar panel that would act as the power source of ROLSS and a radio system that would perform the primary functions of ROLSS. The radio system was expected to receive a radio signal below 20 MHz, convert the signal into a digital format, and store the data for later data analysis.

		<h2>  Characterization of Solar Panels</h2>
				<!-- SUMMARY OF SOLAR PANEL-->
		<p class="col-2-2"> In order to equip the ROLSS with the most efficient power source, we tested four types of solar cells that might be used for the spacecraft. The solar cells were tested by measuring the highest voltage and current found under ambient indoor fluorescent light, under a green laser, and under bright direct sunlight. These three different lighting conditions were used to both test our procedure and to compare the solar cell’s reactions to different wavelengths of light. The power generated by each solar cell was calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current. The solar cells were also weighed on a small digital scale with an accuracy level of 10^3. Cost of each solar cell was found in receipts included with the solar cells. Several secondary values were calculated from these values, such as cost per area, power per area, power per mass, and cost per power, to better compare the solar cells since all are different sizes and weights. </p>
		
		<!-- SUMMARY OF SOLAR PANEL-->
		<!-- PANEL 1 BOX -->
		<div class="clear-box col-2-4">
		  	<h3> Gallium Arsenide</h3>
		  	<p> We first tested a gallium-arsenide solar cell that was sold as a scrap shard of a larger high-quality solar cell. Because it was a scrap shard, the price was relatively low: only $150.00 for 50 shards. The gallium-arsenide solar cell was soldered to two wires so voltage and current in the shard could be measured with a multimeter. Power in the gallium-arsenide solar cell under ambient light was 1.20*10^-5 W, under a green laser was 1.47*10^-3 W, and under bright sunlight was 6.06*10^-2 W. The gallium-arsenide solar cell showed a lot of potential as a high-efficiency and very light solar cell, as its ratio of power to mass be 0.272 W/g. However, the shards are both very small, 2.057 cm^2, and very fragile. This means that the gallium-arsenide solar cells will have to be specially mounted and protected so that they do not break during launch or during landing. Unfortunately, since the shards are so small, the cost to power ratio is $49.50 watts. Thus, this form of solar cell adds cost for both small size and mounting. However, the small mass could save costs in other areas of the spacecraft, thus evening out expenses. </p>

		  	<h3> Copper-Indium</h3>
		  	<p>  A copper-indium solar cell sold for $1.00 during a Ham Radio Fest. Thus, the given price for the solar cell used during testing might be much lower than the cost of new copper-indium solar cells. Wires were soldered to the
			contacts on the copper-indium solar cell so it could easily be measured with a multimeter. Power in the copper-indium solar cell under ambient light was 1.28*10^-5 W, under a green laser was 7.60*10^-5 W, and under bright sunlight was 3.76*10^-1
			W. The copper-indium solar cell had a very strong preference for sunlight rather than other forms of light. While it generated much more energy than the gallium-arsenide solar cell, this seems to be only an effect of the copper-indium solar cell’s
			larger size, as the power to area ratio was 0.0122 W/cm^2, compared to gallium-arsenide solar cell’s ratio of 0.0295 W/cm^2. The power to mass ratio was also relatively low at 0.0205 W/g. However, while this solar cell is less efficient and heavier,
			the cost was very low with a cost to power ratio of $0.03. These copper-indium solar cells are also very durable meaning that very little preparation is needed before they can be used on a spacecraft.</p>

		  	<h3> Solar Sphere</h3>
		  	<p> The Solar Sphere has electric wires on it but in order to test it, we attached wires to the copper ends. The copper end had to be soldered to get a better read from the Multimeter. This solar array is $26 for 5 solar arrays. It has 24cm x 20cm dimensions.
			The area is 480 cm2. It weight too much to be weight on the scale. Compared to the other solar cells the weight is significantly heavier. Under the ambient light, the voltage is 4.03 V with a current of 0.35 mA. With the laser, the voltage is 5.22
			V and a current of 0.64 mA. Outside in sunlight the solar sphere has a voltage of 10.18 V and a current of 76.5 mA. The power is 1.7x10-3 W. The cost of one Solar Sphere per cm2 is $0.01. The power per cm2 is 8.19x10-1. </p>

		  	<h3> Pumpkin</h3>
		  	<p>Pumpkin Solar Array that is $2500. When starting to test under ambient light, the solar array voltage kept increasing. This was probably due to being in the protective cover it was package in. When the testing the solar
			array in direct sunlight, the Multimeter was reading a very low voltage. This voltage was lower than what it was under the ambient light. We test the solar array a second time and the reading started to be more precise without the reading constantly
			increasing. The Pumpkin solar array has voltage is 0.562 V under ambient light with a current of 0.43 mA. With the pointer laser light, the voltage is 2.90 V and a current of 1.70 mA. The voltage of the Pumpkin solar array is 5.02 V in direct sunlight
			with a current of 216 mA. The power output is 1.084 W. It is an 8.2cm x 10.5cm board with a weight is 37.03 g. The area is 480 cm2. The cost per cm2 is $29.04. It has a power of 1.41x10-2 W/cm2. </p>

			<!-- SOLAR PANEL CONCLUSION -->
			<p class="col-2-2">With testing the four solar cells, each solar cell can have some upsides in being a source of power for a spacecraft. The negatives points of the solar cells are what can help a final decision in picking the best solar cell. The Gallium Arsenide is very fragile and can break easily, but for a small size, it can give off a good amount of power. The Copper Indium is more durable and gives off a suitable power when comparing it to its cost. The solar sphere weight and size is what makes it not suitable for a spacecraft. Comparing its power to its weight to the other three solar cells, it would not be a good choice. The Pumpkin solar array cost way more than the other three cells.</p>

	<!-- ETCHING SECTION -->
	<section class="blue-box col-2-3">
		<h2> Ecthing Process</h2>
		
		  <p> The objective of this experiment was to calibrate the etchant.
		  First, a circle of the Kapton Copper film was cut to fit the inner diameter of a glass petri dish.  The petri dish used in this experiment was 4 inches in diameter.  The mass of the circle of Kapton Copper film was measured and found to be 1.168 grams.  The etchant used was a Ferric Chloride solution (Stock Number: 12-2038).   A fractal pattern was drawn on the copper side of the film using an etch resist pen (B#:13045) and extraneous lines were drawn on using a Sharpie pen to compare performance.  </p>
		  <p>Then, the film circle was placed in the petri dish and 3 mL doses of Ferric Chloride were added until the circle was adequately covered.  A total of 15 mL was used in this experiment.  After the etchant had stopped reacting and the Kapton film was clearly seen in all areas not covered by etch resist pen or Sharpie pen, the Ferric Chloride was sprayed with water and disposed of.  The circle was repeatedly washed with water to neutralize and wash off the rest of the Ferric Chloride.  The time it took for the copper to be completely etched off was found to be 5 minutes and 21 seconds.  Since Ferric Chloride is highly corrosive and toxic, this experiment was performed outside using rubber gloves and safety goggles.</p>
		  <p>In order to make the antennas needed for the ROLSS mission, this process must be replicated on a large scale. One possibility is to have one tank of etchant and one tank of neutralizer, positioned in such a way that one can feed a roll of Kapton Copper film first into the etchant and then into the neutralizer.  This should be performed under a negative pressure hood and with rubber gloves and goggles, as large amounts of Ferric Chloride are highly toxic and corrosive.  Transmission lines can be attached to the roll of Kapton Copper film using a conductive epoxy such as silver epoxy.</p>
		  <p>As a result of this experiment, the precise amount of Ferric Chloride can be determined for larger scales and the amount of time that would take for the Ferric Chloride to etched off the copper of a certain area.</p>

			<h2> Solar Panel Array</h2>
		  	<p> The solar panel could serve as the power source for ROLSS. The panel is a 5x8 array of gallium-arsenide solar shards soldered together. The solar panel is 16 V and 100 mA. The panel is connected to a voltage regulator that brings the voltage down to 12V to reduce power fluctuations. The voltage regulator includes a diode so the array can be used to charge  Nickel Cadmium batteries.</p>

			<h2> Radio Receiver </h2>
		  	<p> For the prototype, a function generator is attached to a transmitter and an antenna acts as the sun, producing a signal of 2.5 KHz. The transmitter sends out the 2.5 KHz signal in a 0.68 MHz wave.   The receiver act as part of ROLSS and is used to pick up the signal from the transmitter. The receiver was constructed by taking apart an  AM transistor radio. 
			The signal is then fed from the receiver to a data logger, which converts the analog radio signal into a digital signal.  This digital signal is stored in the data loggers micro SD card for later computer analysis.
			The data logger does not pick up negative voltages. So in order for the data logger to pick up the negative data, an operational amplifier circuit was added.
			Each stage of construction was tested with an oscilloscope to see whether the correct signal was being received.</p>

				<h3> Results/Data</h3>
		  		<p>Though our initial readings from our data logger had a fair amount of interference, we were able to greatly reduce the problem by constructing a signal offset circuit.  Our final results from our data logger shown below clearly resemble the sine wave sent out by our AM radio, with a signal ranging from approximately 0 to 3 volts.</p>
		  
		  		<h3> Conclusion </h3>
		  		<p>The goal of this project was to receive a signal below 20 MHz, convert the signal into digital, and store the digital data in the data logger.  After adding an operational amplifier and making adjustments to the AM radio receiver, the data logger successfully recorded a signal that  looked like the sine wave produced by the signal generator. 
				The next step in this prototype is to have remote communication between the data logger and the computer to simulate communication between the ROLSS and Earth. The capacitance of the radio receiver can also be lowered to obtain a clearer signal.  The ROLSS prototype can be made more compact by directly soldering the circuit together.</p>
